About the CRDC
****************************************************************************

The Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) is a survey of all public schools and school districts in the United States. The CRDC measures student access to courses, programs, staff, and resources that impact education equity and opportunity for students. The CRDC is a longstanding and critical aspect of the overall enforcement and monitoring strategy used by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In addition, the CRDC is a valuable resource for other federal agencies, policymakers and researchers, educators and school officials, parents and students, and other members of the public who seek data on student equity and opportunity.

A note on data quality
*****************************************************************************

OCR places a high priority on ensuring the accuracy of CRDC data. The data submission system includes a series of embedded edit checks to ensure significant data errors are corrected before a district submits its data. Additionally, each district is required to certify the accuracy of its submission. Although OCR performs these robust data quality checks, there are known data issues and concerns. More information on data quality can be found in the Data Notes 2015-16 CRDC September 2018.pdf file included in the documentation folder or online at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/DataNotes.
